Boni Garcia. Software Engineer & Assistant Professor
====================================================

I love Software Engineering and Networking, and so I have a PhD in Information	and Communications Technology from <a href="http://www.upm.es/">Universidad Politécnica de Madrid</a> (Spain). My main interests are Web Engineering, Open Source, Software Testing, Multimedia and Java.

I work as a reseracher at <a href="http://www.urjc.es/">Universidad Rey Juan Carlos</a> (Spain). We are developing <a href="http://www.kurento.org/">Kurento</a>, which is an open source platform devoted to simplify the development of multimedia applications.

I also work as an Assistant Professor at <a href="http://www.u-tad.com/">U-tad, Centro Universitario de Tecnología y Arte Digital</a> (Spain). I teach "Introduction to Computer Networks" and "Web Programming".
